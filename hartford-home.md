title: Hartford - Coyote Flaco Restaurant
description: Welcome to Coyote Flaco Hartford located in Hartford’s quiet southwest, we’ve been serving up quality Mexican food straight from our parent’s recipes since 1999. Also, we make great margaritas and when the weather is nice, you can sit outside on the patio. On those pesky, dreary winter days and it’s too cold to go outside, WE DELIVER!!
